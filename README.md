I completed this JetBrains Python Project on Sunday, 2022-03-13, ~4:00 PM  
The program asks
- the number of persons you'll be eating with  
- their names
- how much the bill is
- if you'd like the program to choose a lucky person that will not have to pay  

Based on that information, it prints a dictionary showing how much each person owes
